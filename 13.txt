ðŸ”¹ 1. eksctl (Quick Setup / Demos / POCs)

Best for: Quick, one-off cluster creation or learning EKS.

Pros:

Single command creates EKS cluster, nodegroups, IAM roles.

Good for beginners.

Cons:

Not declarative (harder to manage long-term infra).

Limited in CI/CD pipelines.

ðŸ‘‰ Use if you want fast cluster creation for testing.

ðŸ”¹ 2. AWS CLI / AWS Console

Best for: Very specific configurations or when scripting is enough.

Pros:

Direct control over AWS resources.

Good for debugging or step-by-step manual setup.

Cons:

Not scalable.

Hard to reproduce across teams.

ðŸ‘‰ Use if you need custom step-by-step control or debugging.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Terraform (Infrastructure as Code, Multi-Cloud Ready)

Best for: Production-grade infra with version control.

Pros:

Full IaC (infrastructure as code).

Works across multi-cloud + AWS.

State management + easy rollback.

Cons:

More learning curve than eksctl.

Need to manage Terraform state (though S3 + DynamoDB helps).

ðŸ‘‰ Use if you want scalable, reusable, and version-controlled infra.

ðŸ”¹ 4. AWS CDK / CloudFormation

Best for: Teams already deep in AWS ecosystem.

Pros:

Native AWS support.

Works seamlessly with IAM, CloudWatch, etc.

Cons:

Lock-in to AWS (not portable like Terraform).

More verbose than Terraform.

ðŸ‘‰ Use if your team is all-in on AWS.

ðŸ”¹ 5. AWS CodePipeline + GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux)

Best for: Continuous delivery + cluster management.

Pros:

Automates deployments to EKS.

Integrates with Git for GitOps.

Cons:

More moving parts.

Needs Terraform/CloudFormation for initial setup anyway.

ðŸ‘‰ Use for CI/CD automation once cluster is live.
